Hello all, 
Today I will be giving a demo of the History module, 
which is a part of Interest App project, being developed by verinite Team. 
We will be developing multiple microservices for different module as part of this development. 
History module is one such microservice, which we have deployed on AWS for this demo purpose. 
This service exposes different CRUD operations. Using these operations, 
we can perform different operations on history related data, such as save retrieve, etc. 
Now I will perform different operation using swagger tool .
Lets start with post operation, which will insert a new row in the history table, 
then explain here a bit .... and similarly go ahead with all the operations.
